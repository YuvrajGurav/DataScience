    "The \"try-except\" block is a fundamental construct in many programming languages, including Python. It is used for error handling and allows you to catch and handle exceptions, which are unexpected or exceptional events that occur during the execution of a program. The general purpose of a try-except block is to prevent the program from crashing or terminating abruptly when an error occurs.\n",
    "The code that might raise an exception is placed within the \"try\" block.\n",
    "If an exception occurs during the execution of the code within the try block, the rest of the block is skipped, and the program jumps to the corresponding \"except\" block.\n",
    "The \"except\" block contains the code that handles the exception. It specifies what actions should be taken when a specific type of exception is encountered.\n",
    "If the exception raised within the try block matches the type specified in the except block, that except block is executed. If the exception does not match any of the specified types, it is propagated to the calling code or, if not caught, it results in the program terminating with an error message."
